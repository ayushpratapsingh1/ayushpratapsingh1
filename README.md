## About Me

I am a Cloud and DevOps Engineer with a growing focus on FinOps practices.  
My professional interests revolve around designing scalable, cost-efficient, and observable cloud systems.  
I enjoy solving problems related to infrastructure automation, deployment workflows, and cloud cost governance.

Currently, I am deepening my expertise in Kubernetes, Infrastructure as Code (Terraform), and AWS cloud architecture.  
I also work on FinOps automation projects that integrate cloud run functions, AWS Lambda, and Grafana dashboards for real-time cost monitoring.

I believe in building reliable systems that are not only technically efficient but also financially optimized.
